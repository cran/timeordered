Description: Approaches for incorporating time into network analysis. Methods include: construction of time-ordered networks (temporal graphs); shortest-time and shortest-path-length analyses; resource spread calculations; data resampling and rarefaction for null model construction; reduction to time-aggregated networks with variable window sizes; application of common descriptive statistics to these networks; vector clock latencies; and plotting functionalities. The package supports <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0020298>.
